/* PS1- Fountains are installed at every position along a one-dimensional garden of length n. Array locations[] represents the coverage limit of these fountains. The ith fountain (where 1sisn) has a coverage limit of locations[i] that can range from the position max((i â€“ locations[i]), 1) to min((i + locations[i]), n ). In other words, the h fountains do not reach outside the boundaries of the garden. In the beginning,all the fountains are switched off. Determine the minimum number of fountains that need to be activated to cover the n length garden by water.*/
